> **The signatures are different from ReVanced Manager. You must uninstalling the application patched by RV Manager for use these releases (export your settings before uninstalling it).**

and click on app.revanced.android.gms-xxxxxxxxx-signed.apk :

This step is optional, but if the applications refuse to install, it's possible that Play Protect is blocking the installation. In this case, and **only in this case**, follow this step.


Go to Play Store, click on your profile picture and press :

Click on "No harmful apps found"

Click on the gear at the top right of the screen :

<img src=".github/Installation/07.png">

and disable "Scan apps with Play Protect" :

If you had to disable it to install these applications, reactivate it once all the steps are finished.

---

click (in the notification bar) on app.revanced.android.[...].apk first

<img src=".github/Installation/09.png">

if you have never installed applications from the Web, you need to Enable in the settings "Unknown Sources"

and allow permission for install apps :

Another pop-up will appear, click on "install".

Once microG Services is installed, click on OK and click on YT-ReReX (in the notification bar) and click on "Install"
