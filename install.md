  <summary>Manual installation</summary>

> **The signatures are different from ReVanced Manager. You must uninstalling the application patched by RV Manager for use these releases (export your settings before uninstalling it).**
#

Go to [Releases](https://github.com/kevinr99089/ReVancedBuilder) page, scroll down and click on the application you want (For my exemple, YT-ReVanced), then on [MicroG-RE](https://github.com/WSTxda/MicroG-RE/releases/latest) (required for use these mods):

<img src=".github/Installation/03.png">

and click on MicroG_RE_x.x.apk :

<img src=".github/Installation/04.png">

---

This step is optional, but if the applications refuse to install, it's possible that Play Protect is blocking the installation. In this case, and **only in this case**, follow this step.


Go to Play Store, click on your profile picture and press :

<img src=".github/Installation/05.png">

Click on "No harmful apps found"

<img src=".github/Installation/06.png">

Click on the gear at the top right of the screen :

<img src=".github/Installation/07.png">

and disable "Scan apps with Play Protect" :

<img src=".github/Installation/08.png">

If you had to disable it to install these applications, reactivate it once all the steps are finished.

---

click (in the notification bar) on MicroG_RE_x.x.apk first

<img src=".github/Installation/09.png">

if you have never installed applications from the Web, you need to Enable in the settings "Unknown Sources"

<img src=".github/Installation/10.png">

and allow permission for install apps :

<img src=".github/Installation/11.png">

Another pop-up will appear, click on "install".

<img src=".github/Installation/12.png">

Once MicroG is installed, click on OK and click on YT-ReVanced (in the notification bar) and click on "Install"

<img src=".github/Installation/13.png">

Once done, Go to Home screen (or Settings > Apps), and go to MicroG settings :

<img src=".github/Installation/14.png">

Go to permissions settings :

<img src=".github/Installation/15.png">

and enable everything :

<img src=".github/Installation/16.png">

Return to the previous menu and disable battery optimizations :

<img src=".github/Installation/17.png">

and you're done. In YT, click on the top right corner and click on "+" to sign in to your Google account.
