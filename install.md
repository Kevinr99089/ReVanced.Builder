    <summary>About Regular Expressions on Obtainium</summary>

  Obtainium can be used on other repositories or other sites, regular expressions can be useful.

  Q- What are regular expressions?

  A- Regular expressions can be used to filter applications in releases (particularly useful when a release contains several applications) :

  <img src=".github/Installation/30.png">

In the example, there are 2 applications `yt-revanced` and `music-revanced`.
If you choose `yt-revanced` as the regular expression, Obtainium will suggest all applications containing this name, or (as in the example) automatically choose and download this application instead of asking you for it with each new release. By clicking on "invert regular expression", it will suggest all applications not containing `yt-revanced` in the name (in my example, it will download `music-revanced` by default).

However, avoid selecting the application version as a regular expression, because in case of update, the requested version may no longer be available.

More information here: https://github.com/ImranR98/Obtainium/wiki#basics .

In addition to regular expressions, Obtainium is useful for facilitating installation, checking for updates regularly (according to the duration selected in the app settings), and sending you a notification to let you know when an update is available for your applications. You can combine it with Shizuku to automate the installation of updates. however, when there is more than one release, it may not install automatically.
